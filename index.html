        <h3>🎓 Texas A&M University (2023 – Present)</h3>
        <p>
          Studying <strong>Management Information Systems</strong> at Mays
          Business School has helped me master data analytics, workflow
          automation, and project management fundamentals. Courses in database
          management, business analysis, and systems design built my technical
          foundation and curiosity for technology-driven strategy.

        <h3>💼 JBCF Business Solutions — Business Analyst Intern (2025)</h3>
        <p>
          I learned how to transform data into actionable financial insights.

        <h3>🚀 Netshares — Business Development Intern (2025)</h3>
        <p>
          At Netshares, I deepened my skills in <strong>digital analytics</strong>
          and <strong>CRM optimization</strong>. By analyzing website and SEO
          performance, I helped increase lead-conversion efficiency by 30%.
          I also learned how marketing and data work together to grow client

        <h3>📊 Donovan & Co — Strategy Analyst (2025 – Present)</h3>
        <p>
          As a Strategy Analyst, I apply both my technical and business skills.
          I’ve performed market analysis following Party City’s liquidation,
          identified $1 MM in new retail demand, and helped raise $150 K in
          investor funding through strategic pitch materials. This role has
          strengthened my ability to analyze industries and craft data-backed
          growth strategies.

      <div class="event">
        <h3>🎈 Entrepreneurial Projects (2025)</h3>

          marketing strategy and digital operations, reaching over 1,200 weekly
          impressions. I also contributed to <strong>All-Star Franchise</strong>
          by improving CRM systems and onboarding workflows—hands-on lessons in
